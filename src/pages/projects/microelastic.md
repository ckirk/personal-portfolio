MicroElastic is building the data-driven future of precision dermatology by developing a handheld device that uses ultrasound to instantly quantify the physical properties of skin, replacing subjective manual palpation that is currently used in clinical practice. Our platform will unlock the potential of skin properties to be used for precision medicine, improving patient care and extending lives for patients with heretofore challenging-to-stage disease.
