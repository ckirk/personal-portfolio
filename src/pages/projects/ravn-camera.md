Designed and developed functional hardware prototypes for use by the Navy SEALs to control head-mounted AR displays in the field. RAVN was accepted into Y Combinator (W19) with the use of these prototypes.

Odin, Ravn’s first product, enables service members to safely and effectively partner with machines during their operations. With Odin’s tactical head-worn display and rail-mounted controller, operators can use the system while maintaining head-up awareness and an at-the-ready posture. Odin’s software platform provides the connective layer that makes all these devices accessible from one device, an intelligent information routing system that ensures operators receive only the information they need, and an intuitive user interface designed to minimize distractions. Odin allows service members to maximize the utility of the systems they operate with, pushing Human-Machine Teaming to a new level.
